## PLAN

client can select either word, sentence, or paragraph then input how many they would like generated.

landing page will show title, subtitle explain what lorem is, option for word/sentence/paragraph, with numerical input, then there will be placeholder. Placeholder text will be set to one sentence of lorem onload.

## COMPONENT PLANNING

- input for client to put in how many words/sentences/paragraphs generate
- selector for word / sentence / paragraphs
- container for generated text

- need to save the numerical input in a state
- need to save selector into state
- button to generate to take selector state + number state and output state value
